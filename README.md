# ☀️ SolarSurge Dashboard Demo

Welcome to the official demo of the **SolarSurge Dashboard** — a frontend interface that showcases how users can monitor and manage their energy contribution to the DePIN-powered ecosystem.

SolarSurge automatically routes your **excess solar energy** into:

- 🌞 **Bitcoin Mining**
- 🧠 **AI/Compute Tasks**
- ⛏️ **ORE Mining on Solana**

In return, you earn **SST tokens** for every kWh consumed, with the flexibility to:
- Reinvest Bitcoin earnings into **zBTC**
- Fuel DePIN services in our marketplace
- Track real-time yield, surplus energy, and usage

---

## 🔧 Built With

- **Next.js** – Lightning-fast React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** – Safer development
- **Chart.js / Recharts** – Visual energy insights
